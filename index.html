<span itemprop="name">j2recover</span></h1>

which can be used for mounted or unmounted jfs2 file systems.
</p>

<p>
When j2recover is used for unmounted file system,
it will try best to recover inodes in their original location without copy,<br/>
thus greatly improved the performance since it minimized the IO activity,
and also greatly saved disk space for restore.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes some file systems of production system can not be unmounted when files are wrongly deleted.<br/>
In such case j2recover can be used for mounted file system,
and it will copy restored files to specified location.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes deleted files maybe has been overwritten by other files.
But some files(such as text file) might still valuable even it has been partially overwritten.<br/>
j2recover can also restore deleted files even they are partially or totally overwritten.
And j2recover will report what blocks are overwritten in the file.<br/>
Thus user can check the file content and get those valuable data without overwriting.
