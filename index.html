<h1>AIX JFS2 Data Recovery Tool:  j2recover</h1>
<hr>
<p>j2recover is the most powerful tool for jfs2 data recovery in AIX, 
which can be used for mounted or unmounted jfs2 file systems.

When j2recover is used for unmounted file system,
it will try best to recover inodes in their original location without copy,<br>
thus greatly improved the performance since it minimized the IO activity,
and also greatly saved disk space for restore.

In such case j2recover can be used for mounted file system,
and it will copy restored files to specified location.
